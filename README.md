# Diagnosis-via-speech
* Short-Term Goal: to effectively apply deep learning to speech data. 
* Long-term Goal: to diagnose various speech disorders from speech input via mobile app.  


## Phase 1: general speech - experiment with neural networks
* Experiment with how neural networks learn from speech data. Collect a lot of speech data and extract relevant features.
* Learn how to apply neural networks to speech of various languages, men vs women (if possible), adults vs children, differnt emotions, etc. 
* Develop simple, fun mobile applications based on the models

## Phase 2: clinical speech - maximize model performance!!!
* (Try to) find enough clinical speech data... 
* Overcome challenges of limited data --> make apps that could collect speech data? Write research institutions and ask for their data?
* Apply deep learning to speech data and work to maximize model performance. Need to consider Type I and Type II errors - better to have a false alarm than miss a diagnosis.
* Given available data, plan mobile application for that population (i.e. speech data of people with aphasia --> develop app for that population; speech dataa of children with SLI (keep dreaming....) --> develop app for children; etc.) 

## Phase 3: medical app - game development?
* For adults and children, try to present the app as a game. Create game with Unity/Blender? 
* Develop mobile app that takes in the user's speech and can diagnose what kind of aphasia they have or if they have a language development disorder like SLI or dyslexia!!!! (Or... that they speak English with a German accent... we'll see!)
